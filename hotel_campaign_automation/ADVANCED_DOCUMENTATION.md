# Advanced Documentation for Hotel Campaign Automation

## Overview
This document provides advanced details about the Hotel Campaign Automation project, including descriptions of the implemented models, integration with the Gemini API, and usage examples.

## Time Series Forecasting Models
The project utilizes the following time series forecasting models to predict hotel occupancy rates:

### LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
- **Description**: LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) capable of learning long-term dependencies. It is well-suited for time series forecasting tasks.
- **Usage**: The LSTM model is trained on historical occupancy data to predict future occupancy rates.
- **Implementation**: The model is implemented using TensorFlow/Keras and integrated into the backend.

### ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
- **Description**: ARIMA is a popular statistical model used for time series analysis and forecasting. It captures temporal structures in the data.
- **Usage**: The ARIMA model is used to forecast occupancy rates based on historical data.
- **Implementation**: The model is implemented using the `statsmodels` library.

### Prophet
- **Description**: Prophet is a forecasting tool developed by Facebook that handles missing data and shifts in the trend automatically.
- **Usage**: The Prophet model is used to generate forecasts for occupancy rates.
- **Implementation**: The model is implemented using the `prophet` library.

## Customer Segmentation Models
The project employs the following models for customer segmentation:

### K-Means
- **Description**: K-Means is a clustering algorithm that partitions data into K distinct clusters based on feature similarity.
- **Usage**: The K-Means model is used to segment customers based on their booking behavior and preferences.
- **Implementation**: The model is implemented using the `scikit-learn` library.

### DBScan (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
- **Description**: DBScan is a clustering algorithm that groups together points that are closely packed and marks points in low-density regions as outliers.
- **Usage**: The DBScan model is used to identify clusters of customers with similar booking patterns.
- **Implementation**: The model is implemented using the `scikit-learn` library.

## Campaign Trigger Models
The project uses the following models to trigger marketing campaigns:

### XGBoost
- **Description**: XGBoost is an optimized gradient boosting library designed to be highly efficient and flexible.
- **Usage**: The XGBoost model is used to predict the likelihood of a customer booking a room, triggering targeted marketing campaigns.
- **Implementation**: The model is implemented using the `xgboost` library.

### Random Forest
- **Description**: Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees for classification and regression tasks.
- **Usage**: The Random Forest model is used to determine the optimal timing for marketing campaigns.
- **Implementation**: The model is implemented using the `scikit-learn` library.

## Integration with Gemini API
- **Version**: 1.5
- **Usage**: The Gemini API is used to fetch real-time data for occupancy forecasting and campaign optimization.
- **Endpoints**: The API provides endpoints for retrieving hotel data and updating campaign settings.

## Usage Examples and Best Practices
- **Forecasting**: Use the `/forecast_occupancy` endpoint to obtain occupancy predictions for the upcoming weeks.
- **Segmentation**: Use the `/segment_customers` endpoint to retrieve customer segments for targeted marketing.
- **Campaign Optimization**: Use the `/optimize_campaign` endpoint to determine the best timing and content for marketing campaigns.
